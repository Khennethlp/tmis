Tube Making Inventory System (TMIS) is an enhanced system designed to optimize the accuracy of data flow within the current process.

The system's primary functions involve the storage of PVC and COT materials through QR code scanning for both incoming and outgoing processes, along with the corresponding rack locations.

Initially, the user or administrator scans the QR codes of the rack location and materials for storage. Subsequently, only the QR code of the materials needs to be scanned for outgoing materials.

This system features distinct interfaces:
1. Stores Page: Facilitating both incoming and outgoing actions, accessible by either users or administrators based on authorization granted by the super admin.
2. Admin Dashboard: Central hub for tasks such as importing, exporting, updating, adding materials or users, inventory and other administrative functions.
